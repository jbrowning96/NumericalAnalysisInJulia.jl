# NumericalAnalysisInJulia.jl
---

A collection of numerical algorithms developed in Julia during the course of  a numerical analysis course. Long term goals for this are along the lines of developing new algorithms or for such algorithms to act as prototyping for a later time to better optimize these routines in C, which Julia makes use of.
